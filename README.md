# System.Collections.Immutable.FSharp

This project is meant to serve as a wrapper over various parts of the [System.Collections.Immutable](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Collections.Immutable/) library. The goal being to make it more usable in F# programs.

It is primarily meant to be used by my own hobby projects. As such no guarantees are made regarding correctness, stability or completeness.
